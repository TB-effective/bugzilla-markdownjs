Bugzilla Markdownjs
===================

This is a markdown extension for bugzilla. All rendering is done client side through javascript. It dynamically adds markdown elements to comments and allows you to switch between the raw view and markdown. It has a live preview when submitting or commenting a bug.

# Forked to Switch to Markdown-it

Note: I (TB) forked this from the original Markdownjs extension because it depended
on the unmaintained (for 10 years) markdownjs lib. Since I wanted to adjust the config,
I switched to the actively maintained and more flexible markdown-it library.

#Features

* Markdown parsing of all comments
* Ability to view raw comment text
* Live markdown preview when creating or commenting
* Unobtrusive & customizable styling
* Formatting help information

#Installation

Copy the `Markdownjs` directory into `<bugzilla-root>/extensions` directory and run `checksetup.pl`.

##Dependencies

* [Jquery](http://jquery.com/) : v1.11.1
* [Markdown-js](https://github.com/evilstreak/markdown-js): v0.6.0-beta1

#Compatibility

Tested with buzillia:

* 4.4.4

Please help this module by testing on more versions.

#Overview

The extension finds all elements with the class `bz_commen_text`, takes their text passes it to markdown-js, and appends the markdown-js output into a new `div` after the comment. The raw comment is hidden by default. You can toggle between the markdown element and raw element by clicking on a link within the comment.

For the comment previews, the extension uses the jquery `on` method to bind to the input events of the `#comment` element. It takes the input, passes it through markdown-js and places the output in the `#bz_preview` element.

This extension relies on the following template hooks: `global/footer-end`, `global/header-additional_header`, `bug/edit-after_comments_textarea`, and `bug/create/create-end`.

The styles.css set the white-space to normal, and change the font to be more readable. If you want better styling, send me a pull request.

**Note:** You could, in theory, remove jQuery and just use the YUI library included with bugzilla. I did not use the YUI because, well, I'm a lazy hack.
